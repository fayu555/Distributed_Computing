The Covid-Predictor (CP)

Prediction of occurrences often involves the use of prediction and optimization algorithms. However, in this project, We intend to use the pattern of the 
pre-existing and existing occurrences of virus to establish the next prediction of any location. This will involve constant monitoring of individuals intelligently in various APIs 
setups and use of drones to collect data from different individuals in different designated locations.

This solution will involve development of an app using python SDK, this will act as the User Interface (UI), with a well secured database at the back-end, most probably oracle.
The database will be configured to allow continues updates intelligently as more data is fetched and fed. This app will majorly rely on the data available in the database.

Prediction of covid 19 prevalence locations will help guide the related government agencies on how to mitigate emergency related issues and offer general health advisory even 
before such calamities happen in a given region.It helps the government to be alert and ready to combat such crisis unlike before where government agencies only reacted to
situations.
